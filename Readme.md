# Payment Service

## Overview
The Payment Service is a Node.js application designed to handle payment processing. It exposes RESTful APIs for creating and managing payments.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- npm (v6.x or later)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd payment-service
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
    ```
    DB_HOST=<your-database-host>
    DB_USER=<your-database-user>
    DB_PASS=<your-database-password>
    DB_NAME=<your-database-name>
    ```

4. **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

5. **API Documentation:**
    API documentation is available at `http://localhost:3000/api-docs` when the server is running.

## Running with Docker

1. **Build the Docker image:**
    ```sh
    docker build -t payment-service .
    ```

2. **Run the Docker container:**
    ```sh
    docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env payment-service
    ```

## Testing

To run tests, use the following command:
```sh
npm test
```

## Project Structure

- `index.js` - Entry point of the application
- `config/db.js` - Database configuration
- `controllers/paymentController.js` - Controller for payment operations
- `models/paymentModel.js` - Mongoose model for payment data
- `routes/paymentRoutes.js` - Express routes for payment endpoints
- `docs/swagger.js` - Swagger documentation setup
```

# Design Document: Payment Service

## Introduction
The Payment Service is designed to provide a scalable and robust system for managing payment processing. It offers RESTful APIs for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting payment records.

## Architecture
The application follows a typical MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern:

- **Model:** Defines the schema for payment data using Mongoose.
- **View:** Not applicable as this is a backend service.
- **Controller:** Handles the business logic for payment operations.
- **Routes:** Defines the API endpoints and links them to the appropriate controller methods.

## Components

### Database
- **MongoDB** is used as the database to store payment records.
- Configuration is handled in `config/db.js`.

### API Endpoints
- **POST /payments:** Create a new payment.
- **GET /payments:** Retrieve all payments.
- **GET /payments/:id:** Retrieve a specific payment by ID.
- **PUT /payments/:id:** Update a specific payment by ID.
- **DELETE /payments/:id:** Delete a specific payment by ID.

### Error Handling
- Centralized error handling is implemented to ensure consistent responses.

### Validation
- Request data validation is performed using middleware.

## Future Enhancements
- Add authentication and authorization.
- Implement more robust logging.
- Add support for more payment methods.
